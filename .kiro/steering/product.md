# Product Overview

WriteHERE is an AI-powered recursive writing system that generates long-form content through hierarchical task decomposition and execution. The system specializes in creating structured narratives including stories, books, and reports by breaking down complex writing tasks into manageable subtasks.

## Core Capabilities

- **Recursive Task Planning**: Decomposes complex writing goals into hierarchical task graphs
- **Multi-Modal Content Generation**: Supports story writing, book writing, and report generation
- **Memory-Enhanced Writing**: Uses Mem0 for persistent memory and context management
- **Search-Augmented Generation**: Integrates web search for factual content and research
- **Graph-Based Knowledge**: Leverages Memgraph for relationship modeling and Neo4j compatibility
- **Vector Storage**: Uses Qdrant for semantic search and content retrieval

## Writing Modes

1. **Story Mode**: Creative fiction with character development, plot progression, and narrative structure
2. **Book Mode**: Structured non-fiction with research integration and comprehensive coverage
3. **Report Mode**: Analytical content with data-driven insights and factual accuracy

The system uses a sophisticated agent-based architecture where different agents handle planning, execution, reflection, and aggregation tasks in a coordinated workflow.
